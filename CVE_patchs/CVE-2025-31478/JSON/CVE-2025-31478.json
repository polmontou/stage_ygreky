In particular:\n+  - The new `S3_SKIP_CHECKSUM`\n+    [setting](../production/upload-backends.md#s3-backend-configuration)\n+    is required to prevent AWS\u2019s S3 client libraries from refusing to make\n+    requests to some third-party S3 implementations \u2014 specifically, those that\n+    don\u2019t yet support AWS\u2019s new checksum algorithm. (Zulip 9.x used older\n+    versions of these libraries that did not attempt to enforce AWS's new\n+    checksum algorithm).\n+  - Google Cloud Storage requires some additional configuration; see the\n+    [documentation](../production/upload-backends.md#google-cloud-platform).\n+  - Fixed support for automatically accessing S3 secrets from EC2 instance\n+    profiles.\n+- Fixed compatibility issues between the new `tusd` -based file upload backend\n+  and using a non-default port for the Zulip server.\n+- Added support for PostgreSQL 17.\n+- Direct message conversations are now allowed to wrap to two lines in the left\n+  sidebar using a 2-line format, just like topics.\n+- Fixed an important server availability bug involving thumbnails for large\n+  video files.\n+- Fixed several web application bugs involving displaying group-based\n+  permissions.\n+- Fixed several visual glitches.\n+- Fixed a few bugs in the move conversation modal.\n+- Fixed a bug that prevented new hardening of content access from being\n+  enforced.\n+- Fixed a bug preventing showing archived channels that remain marked as\n+  web-public channels in the public access option. (Prior to Zulip 10.0,\n+  archiving a channel irreversibly made it private, so this bug only impacted\n+  channels archived after the upgrade to Zulip 10.0).\n+- Fixed a subtle issue involving file upload error handling with `tusd`.\n+- Moved the Prometheus metrics port for Smokescreen to 4760, to not conflict\n+  with the ports Zulip uses with more than 10 Tornado processes.\n+- Improved scroll position when selecting a very tall message using the `Up`\n+  keyboard shortcut.\n+- Improved integration URL construction interface for Git integrations.\n+- Improved behavior when viewing a channel feed in channels containing very old\n+  unread messages.\n+- Documented the new LaTeX copy/paste functionality.\n+- Upgraded Python dependencies.\n+- Updated translations.\n+\n ### Zulip Server 10.1\n \n _Released 2025-03-28_\ndiff --git a/version.py b/version.py\nindex 62eb5de0d1..db8223f5fa 100644\n--- a/version.py\n+++ b/version.py\n@@ -1,6 +1,6 @@\n import os\n \n-ZULIP_VERSION = \"10.1+git\"\n+ZULIP_VERSION = \"10.2\"\n \n # Add information on number of commits and commit hash to version, if available\n zulip_git_version_file = os.path.join(\n@@ -14,7 +14,7 @@ ZULIP_VERSION = lines.pop(0).strip()\n ZULIP_MERGE_BASE = lines.pop(0).strip()\n \n LATEST_MAJOR_VERSION = \"10.0\"\n-LATEST_RELEASE_VERSION = \"10.1\"\n+LATEST_RELEASE_VERSION = \"10.2\"\n LATEST_RELEASE_ANNOUNCEMENT = \"https://blog.zulip.com/zulip-server-10-0\"\n \n # Versions of the desktop app below DESKTOP_MINIMUM_VERSION will be"
