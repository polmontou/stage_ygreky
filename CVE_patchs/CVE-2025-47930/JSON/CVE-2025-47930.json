This issue only impacted configurations where\n+  users could create private channels but not public channels, or vice\n+  versa.\n+- Fixed an important bug where the LDAP integration could corrupt\n+  system groups when changing a user\u2019s role, resulting in permissions\n+  not being applied correctly. This release also contains a migration\n+  that corrects the corrupted state for affected systems.\n+- Fixed a bug where uploaded files were incorrectly inaccessible to\n+  users previewing a private channel that they had permission to join.\n+- Fixed multiple live update bugs related to archiving/unarchiving\n+  channels or losing access to a channel.\n+- Fixed sorting of message IDs in the `unread_msgs` API.\n+- Fixed appearance of the top-of-message-feed loading spinner with\n+  non-default font sizes.\n+- Fixed several glitches with save/discard buttons in organization\n+  settings, and updated visual design.\n+- Added the `manage.py thumbnail` management command. This management\n+  command supports generating thumbnails for legacy images that were\n+  uploaded prior to the introduction of thumbnailing in Zulip\n+  9.0. This tools shares its queue with thumbnailing of newly sent\n+  images, so be careful when enqueuing large numbers of images at\n+  once.\n+- Updated translations.\n \n ### Zulip Server 10.2\n \n@@ -33,7 +57,10 @@ _Released 2025-04-15_\n     profiles.\n - Fixed compatibility issues between the new `tusd` -based file upload backend\n   and using a non-default port for the Zulip server.\n-- Added support for PostgreSQL 17.\n+- Added support for PostgreSQL 17.
