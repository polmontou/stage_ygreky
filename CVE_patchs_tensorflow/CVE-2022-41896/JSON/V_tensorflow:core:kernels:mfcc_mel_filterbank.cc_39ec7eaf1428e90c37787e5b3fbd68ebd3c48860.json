For filter i centered at f_i,\n// there is a triangular weighting of the FFT bins that extends from\n// filter f_i-1 (with a value of zero at the left edge of the triangle) to f_i\n// (where the filter value is 1) to f_i+1 (where the filter values returns to\n// zero).\n\n// Note: this code fails if you ask for too many channels.  The algorithm used\n// here assumes that each FFT bin contributes to at most two channels: the\n// right side of a triangle for channel i, and the left side of the triangle\n// for channel i+1.  If you ask for so many channels that some of the\n// resulting mel triangle filters are smaller than a single FFT bin, these\n// channels may end up with no contributing FFT bins.  The resulting mel\n// spectrum output will have some channels that are always zero.\n\n#include \"tensorflow/core/kernels/mfcc_mel_filterbank.h\"\n\n#include <math.h>\n\n#include \"tensorflow/core/platform/logging.h\"\n\nnamespace tensorflow {\n\nMfccMelFilterbank::MfccMelFilterbank() : initialized_(false) {}\n\nbool MfccMelFilterbank::Initialize(int input_length, double input_sample_rate,\n                                   int output_channel_count,\n                                   double lower_frequency_limit,\n                                   double upper_frequency_limit) {\n  num_channels_ = output_channel_count;\n  sample_rate_ = input_sample_rate;\n  input_length_ = input_length;\n\n  if (num_channels_ < 1) {\n    LOG(ERROR) << \"Number of filterbank channels must be positive.\";\n    return false;\n  }\n\n  if (sample_rate_ <= 0) {\n    LOG(ERROR) << \"Sample rate must be positive.\";\n    return false;\n  }\n\n  if (input_length < 2) {\n    LOG(ERROR) << \"Input length must greater than 1.\";\n    return false;\n  }\n\n  if (lower_frequency_limit < 0) {\n    LOG(ERROR) << \"Lower frequency limit must be nonnegative.\";\n    return false;\n  }\n\n  if (upper_frequency_limit <= lower_frequency_limit) {\n    LOG(ERROR) << \"Upper frequency limit must be greater than \"\n               << \"lower frequency limit.\";\n    return false;\n  }\n\n  // An extra center frequency is computed at the top to get the upper\n  // limit on the high side of the final triangular filter.\n  center_frequencies_.resize(num_channels_ + 1);\n  const double mel_low = FreqToMel(lower_frequency_limit);\n  const double mel_hi = FreqToMel(upper_frequency_limit);\n  const double mel_span = mel_hi - mel_low;\n  const double mel_spacing = mel_span / static_cast<double>(num_channels_ + 1);\n  for (int i = 0; i < num_channels_ + 1; ++i) {\n    center_frequencies_[i] = mel_low + (mel_spacing * (i + 1));\n  }\n\n  // Always exclude DC; emulate HTK.\n  const double hz_per_sbin =\n      0.5 * sample_rate_ / static_cast<double>(input_length_ - 1);\n  start_index_ = static_cast<int>(1.5 + (lower_frequency_limit / hz_per_sbin));\n  end_index_ = static_cast<int>(upper_frequency_limit / hz_per_sbin);\n\n  // Maps the input spectrum bin indices to filter bank channels/indices.
